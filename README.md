# Heart-chronic-disease-prediction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early detection and prevention crucial for reducing mortality rates. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based predictive model to identify the likelihood of a person suffering from chronic heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle-related features.
The aim is to provide a reliable tool that assists healthcare professionals in making informed decisions by analyzing medical data. The model is trained using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes patient information such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and other relevant attributes.
